# SSFG (Stochastic ReLU): Stochastically Scaling Features and Gradients for Regularizing Graph Convolutional Networks
<br>

In this repository,  we implement the SSFG (stochastic ReLU) regularization method for regularizing graph convoultional networks. Our paper "SSFG: Stochastically Scaling Features and Gradients for Regularizing Graph Convolutional Networks" is available on Arxiv at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10338](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10338).
